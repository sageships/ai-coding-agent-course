## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This isn't just "how to use Cursor" — it's **how to BUILD Cursor**.

- The architecture that makes AI coding tools work
- Specific techniques that make LLMs good at coding
- How to implement each component yourself
- Why certain design decisions matter

By the end, you'll have built a working AI coding agent and understand exactly how professional tools work.

## 📚 Course Modules

| Module | Duration | Topics |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1. Foundations | 45 min | LLM coding capabilities, agent architecture, setup |
| 2. Tool System | 60 min | Function calling, tool design, agent loop |
| 3. Code Context | 75 min | Tree-sitter, repo maps, embeddings, selection |
| 4. Edit Formats | 60 min | Diffs, search/replace, error handling |
| 5. Agent Loop | 60 min | Planning, reflection, orchestration |
| 6. Advanced Features | 50 min | Git, LSP, testing, web browsing |
| 7. Production | 45 min | Security, cost optimization, UX |
| 8. Final Project | 45 min | Building & deploying your agent |

**Total: ~7 hours**

## 🔑 Key Differentiators

1. **From research, not tutorials** — Based on Anthropic's agent research, Aider's implementation, actual tool architectures

2. **Build, don't just use** — Every concept has working code

3. **Production-grade** — Security, cost, UX considerations included

4. **The hard problems** — Context management, edit formats, error recovery — the stuff that makes real tools work
